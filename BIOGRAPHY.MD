 Brendan started working at Netscape Communications Corporation in April 1995. He created JavaScript on his time at Netscape. The intention behind creating JavaScript was to put Scheme (a minimalist dialect of the Lisp family of programming languages) “in the browser”, and his superiors insisted that the language’s syntax resemble that of Java. As a result, he devised a language that had much of the functionality of Scheme, the object-orientation of Self(an object-oriented programming language based on the concept of prototypes) and the syntax of Java. He completed the first versions of this in ten days in order to accommodate the beta release schedule. This was called Mocha initially, but renamed LiveScript in September 1995, later that year in December 1995 it was named JavaScript in a joint announcement with Sun MicroSystem. Brendan was the right man for this job as he had already built programming languages when he was a college student, “just to experiment in syntax.” Even before joining Netscape, he had also created languages for building extensions into network monitoring tools at Silicon Graphics. In an interview, Brendan tells his interviewer that “I’d done it for fun, just to make my own languages.”. He also designed the first SpiderMonkey engine(written in C) for the Netscape Navigator Browser. Then in 1998 Mozilla inherited Netscape Base Code, which included the SpiderMonkey engine. It was then changed from being written in C in JavaScript 1.5 to comply with the newer standards. However he continued to oversee the development of SpiderMonkey.

 # Mozilla

 Brendan co-founded Mozilla with Jamie Zawinski and others, in early 1998, creating mozilla.org website. This was a free and open source software (FOSS), and the website was meant to manage open-source contributions to the Netscape code base. He was also Mozilla’s chief architect. After AOL shut down the Netscape browser unit in July 2003, after buying Netscape in 1999, Brendan helped spin out the Mozilla Foundation. After being a member of the board of directors of the Mozilla Foundation, Brendan became CTO of the Mozilla Corporation, meant to be the for-profit arm of Mozilla Foundation. Mozilla choose to make Brendan the CEO of Mozilla Corporation on March 24, 2014. Some employees of Mozilla Foundation( a separate organization from Mozilla Corporation) tweeted calls for his resignation, with reference to some of his opinions against same-sex marriage. Although others at Mozilla Corporation spoke out on their blogs in favor of Brendan, he decided to resign and leave Mozilla, in his personal blog he posts, “under the present circumstances, I cannot be an effective leader”

Brave Software, Inc. is an internet browser platform company that has Brave, which is a free and open-source web browser based on Chromium that focuses on users’ privacy, by automatically blocking ads and website trackers. Brendan is the CEO of Brave Software, which raised $2.5 million in early funding from angel investors. Brendan co-created Basic Attention Token (BAT), a cryptocurrency designed for use in the Brave Browser. BAT raised $35 million on its ICO launch in May 2017.

# Opinion on the work and impact
[1](https://www.zdnet.com/article/programming-language-popularity-javascript-leads-5-million-new-developers-since-2017/#:~:text=JavaScript%2C%20including%20CoffeeScript%20and%20Microsoft's,million%20developers%20using%20it%20worldwide.). JavaScript, including CoffeeScript and Microsoft's TypeScript, is by far the most popular language, with 12.4 million developers using it worldwide. <br/>
[2](https://www.statista.com/statistics/793628/worldwide-developer-survey-most-used-languages/). JavaScript is one of the most used programming language among developers worldwide, as of 2021 <br/>
[3](https://www.forumone.com/ideas/javascript-taking-over-world-and-its-got-us-too/). JavaScript is probably the world’s most widely deployed programming language <br/>

From the above statements we can say that JavaScript is certainly popular and is widely used today. It can be said that JavaScript is a central piece of web technology, as it’s the only programming language allowed to run in browsers, so we can say that most if not all of websites today rely on Javascript. It even extends into further development fields with all the frameworks and libraries available today, like react-native for example to build mobile apps and so on. So in my opinion JavaScript and it’s creation by Brendan Eich is very impactful on our lives and the field of technology in general today. Also I personally use Brave Browser and recommend it to everyone as it saves a lot of my time by getting rid of ads and keeps me protected from all the trackers and potential threats with sketchy websites. Hence I find his and his work quite impactful.
